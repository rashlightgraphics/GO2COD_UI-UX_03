#Overview
This Figma prototype showcases a web landing page design intended for a shoe company. The goal of this landing page is to deliver an engaging user experience, clearly communicate key messaging, and drive user actions e.g., sign-ups, purchases, or inquiries.
The design includes several interactive elements and responsive layouts that reflect the user flow, visual hierarchy, and functionality that should be implemented in the final development.
